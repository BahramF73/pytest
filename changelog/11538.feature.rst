Added :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup` (also export as ``pytest.raises_group``) and :class:`pytest.RaisesExc`, as an equivalent to :func:`pytest.raises` for expecting :exc:`ExceptionGroup`. It includes the ability to specify multiple different expected exceptions, the structure of nested exception groups, and flags for emulating :ref:`except* <except_star>`. See :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups` and docstrings for more information.
